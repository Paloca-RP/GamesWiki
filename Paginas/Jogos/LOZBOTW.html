                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule. 
                        10,000 years before the beginning of the game, Hyrule is an advanced civilization, 
                        protected by four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians. 
                        When the evil Calamity Ganon appears and threatens Hyrule, four great warriors were given the title of Champion, 
                        and each piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon while the princess with the blood of the goddess and her appointed knight fought and defeated him by sealing him away.</p>
